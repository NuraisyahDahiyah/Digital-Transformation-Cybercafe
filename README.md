## Business Process
Key business processes of Project Play by CW include inventory management and procurement, service delivery, customer feedback, regular maintenance, and employee management. Gaming equipment and drinks are tracked manually and recorded in the Excel sheets, which is error prone and inefficient. Service delivery emphasizes personalized assistance and prepaid systems, while feedback is collected via Google Forms but lacks interactivity. Regular maintenance includes  routine hardware and software checks to improve the service quality, and the employee management system fosters a supportive workplace, albeit with a manually managed shift schedule and reward system.

### Problems Faced when Using the Manual System 
**1. Manual Inventory Check for Gaming Equipment**
A major problem faced by the manual system is the high risk of inventory inaccuracies due to human error. Employees manually tracking equipment availability can result in mistakes such as miscounting, overlooking items, or failing to promptly update inventory records. These inaccuracies can lead to overbooking or underutilization of resources, causing delays, unmet customer expectations, and potential revenue loss. Additionally, the manual process is time-consuming. It will reduce overall productivity and it will cause more problems as the business grows. These limitations hinder the company’s ability to provide a reliable customer experience, negatively impacting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

</p>

**2. Limited Customer Feedback Platform**
Project Play by CW is collectsfeedback through google form and there is no structured platform to respond to customer feedback. Currently, feedback is one-way, with customers able to voice their opinions, but without receiving timely responses. This lack of interaction leads to customers feeling undervalued and may prevent Project Play from gaining actionable insights to improve service quality and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the feedback analysis is limited as Google Forms only provides basic summaries of responses. For advanced data visualization or deeper analysis, the data must be exported to another tool, adding extra steps and complexity. This lack of an integrated feedback system prevents effective analysis of customer feedback and reduces the ability to implement meaningful improvements.

</p>

**3. Manual Reward System**
The manual reward system at Project Play by CW poses several challenges that can hinder organizational efficiency and employee satisfaction. First, the process is time-consuming, as the manager needs to verify sales, compare KPIs, and calculate commissions, which can delay the distribution of rewards. Also, this reliance on manual input and Excel sheets increases the possibilities of human errors, such as there might be incorrect calculations or data entry, leading to inaccuracies in rewards allocation. Additionally, the system lacks scalability, making it difficult to handle increased data volumes as the business grows. These inefficiencies can result in delays or errors in distributing rewards, potentially causing employee dissatisfaction.

## Automating Business Process with MIS
### Supply Chain Management (SCM)

</p>

The figure above illustrates the current order fulfillment process for gaming equipment rental at Project Play by CW, which is predominantly manual. As the business is relatively new, it has not yet implemented comprehensive SCM systems or automation. One significant inefficiency in the current process is the manual inventory check. Employees must verify the availability of gaming equipment manually, which is both time-consuming and prone to human error. This inefficiency can lead to delays in order processing, miscommunication about equipment availability, and a subpar customer experience. To address these inefficiencies, the proposed SCM business process presents a streamlined order fulfillment process that incorporates SCM principles and automation technologies. The implementation of these automation opportunities will significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of business operations.

### Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

</p>

The current customer feedback process at Project Play by CW is entirely manual, relying on a voluntary system where customers scan a QR code to provide feedback via Google Forms. However, this approach is inefficient and lacks follow-up, creating a one-way interaction that leaves customers feeling undervalued. At Project Play by CW, the manager must manually collect and review the feedback using Excel, which is time-consuming and error-prone, making it difficult to identify trends or address critical issues effectively. This system ultimately limits actionable insights and hinders customer satisfaction improvements. The figure above outlines the existing feedback process, which is manual and lacks a structured system for effective management. In contrast, the proposed CRM business process highlights the proposed feedback process, which leverages CRM integration and automation tools to address these shortcomings. The new process introduces several key improvements designed to enhance efficiency, customer engagement, and actionable insights. 

## Human Resources Management (HRM)

As seen in the figure above, Project Play by CW's staff reward system is currently a labor-intensive, manual procedure with multiple inefficiencies. The procedure depends on managers and employees to manually maintain data, validate member sign-ups, and compute sales—all laborious tasks that are prone to human error. This method raises the possibility of mistakes in crucial areas like commission computations while limiting the organization's efficiency and scalability. Automation and HRM tools are used in the suggested approach shown in the proposed HRM business processto overcome these obstacles and increase overall productivity. The company may increase accuracy, remove duplications, and develop a more open and employee-friendly compensation system by utilizing automation. 

## Methods to Build MIS Systems
The development of the Management Information System (MIS) for Project Play by CW will follow a structured six-phase process. It begins with Systems Analysis to identify problems, conduct a feasibility study, and gather user requirements. This is followed by System Design to create a technical blueprint, including data flow diagrams and a secure database schema. The subsequent phases involve Programming the software, Development & Testing using methodologies like Agile to ensure quality, and Conversion through a phased implementation plan with staff training. The final phase is Production & Maintenance, which focuses on ongoing monitoring, user feedback, and continuous system improvements to ensure long-term effectiveness.

Beyond the core development lifecycle, two critical considerations are embedded throughout the project. First, Security and Compliance are prioritized through measures like data encryption, access controls, and adherence to privacy laws to protect against cyber threats. Second, the system will be built with Scalability and Upgrades in mind, using a modular design to easily integrate future technologies like AI and ensure the MIS can grow with the business.

## IT Infrastructure Needed 
To support the new Management Information System (MIS), Project Play by CW requires a comprehensive and secure IT infrastructure. This setup is designed for reliability, scalability, and seamless integration of the proposed CRM, HRM, and Inventory systems. Infrastructure needed:
1. Hardware 
2. Software & Cloud 
3. Network & Security
4. Data Management & Scalability

**Employee training** is also needed to ensure the MIS systems are properly implemented. Project Play by CW will have to begin provide training for their employees from professionals to ensure they can utilize the MIS effectively and correctly.(Seah, 2024) The training program should only focus on essential features such as managing dashboards and carrying out data analytics. With this, they can reduce human errors in the future of navigating the MIS and maximize the productivity of the MIS implementation hence improving user proficiency. **IT Support** would also be required to ensure operations of the MIS are smooth and whenever issues or bugs within the system were to surface.

## Ending Remarks 
With these MIS systems in place Project Play by CW can improve its manual processes such as manual inventory management, feedback collection, and employee reward systems. By, implementing systems such as Supply Chain Management , Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Human Resource Management (HRM) is recommended to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
